# Connect_Four

Hi everyone! This is my first real coding project I've done. I built a connect four game in the terminal using Python and VS Code.
This took me quite a while to build, and it has lot that can be improved upon, however I am proud of how it turned out.

The program is interacted with by 2 players going back and forth, placing tokens on a board to try and get 4 in a row.
Checks are in place to ensure proper user inputs are given in order to keep the game going.
The game ends when a player gets 4 in a row, whether it be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It will also end if the board fills up with nobody winning!

I am open to hearing about optimizations or further ideas. I plan on revisiting this project as I advance in my computer science/software engineering studies to enhance and build upon it!
